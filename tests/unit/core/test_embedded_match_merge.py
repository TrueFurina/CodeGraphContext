"""#1710: consecutive MATCH clauses inside UNWIND batches merge to comma-form.

LadybugDB's planner silently yields ZERO rows for
`UNWIND $b AS row MATCH (a:File {path: row.p}) MATCH (b:Function {…})` when
the first MATCH is an index-map lookup: each MATCH works alone, chained they
produce nothing, no error is raised — so downstream MERGEs quietly write no
edges. That was the parity gap's exact signature (every File-sourced CALLS
edge and five Struct CONTAINS edges missing on ladybug only, run after run).

The comma form `MATCH (a {…}), (b {…})` is semantically identical for
non-optional patterns and both engines plan it correctly, so the embedded
translation layer now rewrites adjacent MATCH clauses in UNWIND queries.
